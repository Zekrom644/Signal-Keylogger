## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/signal-keylogger.git
cd signal-keylogger
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation
```bash
python keylogger/Main.py
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Starting the Server (Dashboard)

1. Activate virtual environment
2. Run the server:
```bash
python keylogger/Main.py
```
3. The dashboard will open and start listening on port 10000

### Starting the Client (Keylogger)

1. On the target machine (or same machine for testing):
```bash
python keylogger/program.py
```
2. Client will automatically connect to the server
3. Press `ESC` to stop the keylogger

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start Server** - Launch Main.py on the monitoring machine
2. **Start Client** - Launch program.py on the target machine
3. **Monitor** - View real-time data in the dashboard
4. **Refresh** - Click "Refresh" button to clear logs
5. **Theme** - Use Settings menu to switch between light/dark mode

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Threading Model
- **Main Thread** - GUI event loop (PyQt6)
- **Worker Thread** - Socket accept/receive operations (QThread)
- **Listener Thread** - Keyboard event monitoring (daemon thread)
- **Heartbeat Thread** - Connection keep-alive (daemon thread)

### Data Flow
1. Client captures keystroke via pynput
2. Formats with timestamp: `[2024-01-15 10:30:45] example text`
3. Sends through persistent socket connection
4. Server receives and emits Qt signal
5. Main thread updates GUI widget (thread-safe)

### Network Protocol
- **Transport:** TCP over IPv4
- **Encoding:** UTF-8
- **Message Format:** Plain text with prefixes
  - `COMPUTER_INFO: ...`
  - `GEO_LOCATION: ...`
  - `HEARTBEAT`
  - `[timestamp] keystroke data`

### Performance
- **Memory Usage:** ~50MB (GUI), ~20MB (client)
- **Network Overhead:** 99% reduction vs reconnect-per-message
- **Latency:** Near real-time (< 100ms typically)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Windows Security Blocking Execution

**Issue:** Program won't run or immediately closes on Windows

**Cause:** Windows Defender/Security may flag keylogger as potentially unwanted program (PUP)

**Solutions:**

**Option 1: Add Exclusion to Windows Security (Recommended for testing)**
1. Open Windows Security (Windows key → search "Windows Security")
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection**
3. Click **Manage settings** under "Virus & threat protection settings"
4. Scroll down to **Exclusions**
5. Click **Add or remove exclusions**
6. Click **Add an exclusion** → **Folder**
7. Select your project folder (e.g., `C:\path\to\signal-keylogger`)
8. Restart your terminal/IDE

**Option 2: Temporarily Disable Real-time Protection**
1. Open Windows Security
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection**
3. Click **Manage settings**
4. Toggle **Real-time protection** to **Off** (temporarily)
5. Run your program
6. ⚠️ **Remember to turn it back on after testing**

**Option 3: Restore Quarantined Files**
1. Open Windows Security → **Virus & threat protection**
2. Click **Protection history**
3. Find your program files
4. Click **Actions** → **Restore**
5. Then add exclusion (Option 1)

**Note:** This is expected behavior for keylogging software. Always ensure you're using it legally and ethically.

### Client Won't Connect

**Issue:** Client shows "Connection failed" repeatedly

**Solutions:**
- Verify server is running and listening
- Check firewall settings (allow port 10000)
- Verify IP address in `config.json` is correct
- Check if port 10000 is already in use: `netstat -an | grep 10000`

### GUI Crashes on Client Connect

**Issue:** Dashboard crashes when client connects

**Solutions:**
- Ensure you're using the latest version
- Check Python version (requires 3.7+)
- Reinstall PyQt6: `pip install --force-reinstall PyQt6`
- Check console for error messages

### No Keystroke Data Displayed

**Issue:** Client connected but no keystrokes appear

**Solutions:**
- Verify client has keyboard monitoring permissions (macOS/Linux)
- Check if data is being sent (watch client console output)
- Click "Refresh" button on dashboard
- Restart both client and server

### Config File Not Found

**Issue:** "Config file not found" error

**Solutions:**
- Config auto-generates on first run
- Ensure you have write permissions in the directory
- Manually create `config.json` with default values

### Permission Errors (macOS/Linux)

**Issue:** "Accessibility permissions required"

**Solutions:**
- macOS: System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Accessibility
- Linux: May need to run with appropriate permissions
- Add Python to allowed applications
